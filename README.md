# mini-projects
This contains bunch of mini projects written in python.
This repository is in development stage

# 1. Dice project

The will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6.

The program will print what that number is. It should then ask you if youâ€™d like to roll again. 

We need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. 

For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. 

A function is used that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

# 2. Guess The Number

The program will have random library

User will need to guess any number between the range, If the number is equal to randomly generated number it will print "You guessed the number correctly" 

If the number is less than randomly generated number, it will prompt "The guessed number is lower, Pls guess higher number" 

If the number is greater than the randomly generated number, it will prompt "The guessed number is higher, Pls guess lower" 

The program will also give the difference between the user number and randomly generated number.
