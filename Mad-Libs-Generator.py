Project 3: Mad Libs Generator

The Goal: 
The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs. 
For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc. 
Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them 
into a premade story template. Youâ€™ll need prompts for user input,
and to then print out the full story at the end with the input included.

Concepts to keep in mind:

1. Strings
2. Variables
3. Concatenation
4. Print
